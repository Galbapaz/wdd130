        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Gabriel, and I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Software Development
            through
            BYU–Idaho. Alongside my studies, I work part-time as a teacher, which is something I truly enjoy — I love
            helping others learn and grow. I’m also passionate about technology, which perfectly matches my field of
            study.
            Outside of work and school, I spend most of my time with my lovely and beautiful wife, who makes me feel
            complete and brings so much happiness to my life. I also enjoy playing soccer, listening to music, and of
            course, eating pizza, my favorite food! Right now, my family is just my wife and me, and together we make a
            great team. Teaching and technology are my biggest passions, and I’m always excited to keep learning and
            sharing
