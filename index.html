        <p>I’m Gabriel. I’m a committed and hardworking person who is always looking to grow, both
            personally
            and professionally. I take responsibility for my actions and challenges, and when I fall
            behind, I
            focus on improving and catching up rather than giving up. I value learning, integrity,
            and doing
            things the right way. I try to bring a positive attitude into everything I do and treat
            others with
            respect.</p>
