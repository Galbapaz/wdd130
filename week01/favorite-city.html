    <h1>My favorite city</h1>
    <p>Cochabamba is my favorite city because it feels like home no matter how many times I visit.
        Its warm
        climate, beautiful landscapes, and relaxed pace of life create a sense of peace that’s hard
        to find
        elsewhere. The kindness of the people, the rich culture, and the incredible food make every
        moment
        special, turning simple days into unforgettable memories.</p>
